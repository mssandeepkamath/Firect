## Connecting Farmers and Consumers

![fi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90695071/187675137-9fc49f6b-c1ed-440d-837f-b704f3b94094.png)

### How it works:

● Farmers usually sell their produce at MSP in APMC, which will be just enough
to make a living.So we plan to increase the farmers income by buying
produce at a price upto 50% more than that of MSP.

● We aim to deliver the goods fresh to Consumers, so we store in the
distribution centre only for a maximum of 24hrs.

● We plan to tie up with chains of restaurants,Paying Guests and hotels so that
we always have a stable order coming on a daily-basis and also prevents
wastage.

● Since majority of the vegetables and fruits are still sold Offline, Our main aim
would be to convert the existing offline customers to the Online platform.So
we tie up with local vegetable vendors and make them as an partner and pay
them upto 22% commission on the order they sell, which is subsequently
more than what they would get even on the best day.
We would place QR codes on carts so that Consumers could scan it and
would be redirected to a web page where they can add items to cart and also
have payment options(including Cash Payment).And also a promotional
scheme would be displayed stating that the consumers get extra upto 10%
discount on ordering directly from our app.This way we would attract the
offline consumers to the online platform.Through offline we try to attract that 40-70% of population who depends on
vendors for daily needs.

● Firect wants to change the way delivery works, So we incorporate
Freelancing based deliveries, which would help in employment as well as
help us stand out in the market.
Any individual having a driving licence and helmet would be allowed to
participate in this freelancing opportunity.He/She first has to register by giving
basic details so that the process is hassle free and quick.
To prevent Malfunctioning of the system(such as freelancers stealing the
goods), We have come up with the idea of pay and take.
Firect allows maximum of ₹2000 goods per two wheeler.So freelancer first
have to pay the effective cost of the order he is about to deliver and then
would be allowed to deliver.Once the order is delivered we completely return
the deposit along with the freelancing wages to the freelancer, which acts as
shield of protection against malfunctioning.
Now what if the freelancer does not have money?. For this we plan to
collaborate with buy now,pay later fintech companies.

### Differentiating Factor:

● We don't store produce for more than 24 hours, thereby always delivering
fresh.

● We plan to market strategically by using vendors to convert the existing offline
customers to online

● We have a unique delivery system, where we use freelancers for delivering
the produce and also providing employment to our youth.

● Both farmers and Consumers are getting more profitted than the conventional
ways.

● We plan to network with large businesses such as hotels,PG’s(B2B) which
will help us scale up.

● We always prioritise organic goods and also aim to sell at a much cheaper
price than what it is today.
